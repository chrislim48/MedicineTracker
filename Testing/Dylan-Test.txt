Tested files:
backend/src/medicine.js
- Calling createMedicine given prompt from frontend 
- Calling getMedicine to send list of medicines given customer ID
- Calling deleteMedicine to remove specified medicine from the database
- Calling updateMedicine to change values of a medicine

Using Swagger api, these functions were tested in many ways including inputting invalid 
values to see if the error messaghe is sent correctly

frontend/src/components/Medlist.js
- Using axios to call the functions getMedicine, deleteMedicine, and updateMedicine.

Using the frontend interface, I tested if the backend functions were properly called and completed successfully
This includes calling the fucntions multiple times in succession and inputting invalid values
