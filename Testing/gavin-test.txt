WHAT I TESTED:
Login.js - I had to test whether the authentication worked in the backend or not.
I did this by logining in and seeing if it would display the correct information
after I had logged in.

Medform.js - I tested many things on this file. I mostly tested that the medform would
pop up every time the user clicked on "Add New +" or "Edit". I also tested if a new
medication would get created/updated and rendered at the appropritate time.

MedList.js - I tested to make sure that all the components and information for the
correct user was displayed. I also tested that all the buttons worked. 
I also tested to make sure that all the components rendered at appropriate times.
